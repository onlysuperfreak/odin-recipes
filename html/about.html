            Currently I am a Poilice Officer, for 7 years now, in the NYPD and I hate my job lol. So I have deicded to follow my life
            long passion of coding and everything tech related. I'm currently enrolled in a 4 year college and set to
            graduate next year some time. Hopefully I can transition into a full time tech job in the near future.
